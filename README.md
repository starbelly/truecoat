An OTP library used for testing a local hexpm instance.

Use and Contributing
-------------

  This "library" serves no purpose other than to ease setup for myself when doing QA for rebar3_hex against a local hexpm and/or mini_repo instance. That said, I will gladly accept PRs that add functions and so forth that utilize Fargo (the movie) references. 

Build
-----

    $ rebar3 compile
